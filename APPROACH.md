- **Server-side rendering**: Would add complexity without significant benefit for this use case

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Clean Separation of Concerns
```
├── Controllers/            # HTTP request handling
├── Services/              # Business logic
├── Models/                # Data transfer objects
├── NumberToWordsApp.Tests/ # Unit tests (separate project)
└── wwwroot/               # Static web assets
```

**Rationale:**
- **Testability**: Business logic isolated in services can be unit tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between responsibilities
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones
- **Test Isolation**: Separate test project ensures clean separation of concerns

### 2. RESTful API Design
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/numbertowords/convert`
- **Request/Response**: JSON with structured error handling

**Rationale:**
- **Industry Standard**: RESTful APIs are widely understood and documented
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all necessary information
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses provide clear feedback

### 3. Dependency Injection
- Services registered in `Program.cs`
- Controllers receive dependencies via constructor injection

**Rationale:**
- **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies for unit testing
- **Flexibility**: Can switch implementations without changing client code
- **ASP.NET Core Integration**: Built-in DI container eliminates external dependencies

### 4. Test Architecture Design

#### 4.1 Separate Test Project Structure
```
NumberToWordsApp.Tests/
├── NumberToWordsApp.Tests.csproj    # Test project with xUnit framework
├── NumberToWordsServiceTests.cs     # 30 comprehensive unit tests
└── TestResults/                     # Code coverage reports
```

**Rationale:**
- **Project Isolation**: Test project is completely separate from main application
- **Build Independence**: Tests can be built and run independently
- **Framework Specificity**: Test-specific dependencies don't pollute main project
- **CI/CD Integration**: Standard .NET test project structure works with build pipelines

#### 4.2 xUnit Framework Selection
**Chosen Framework**: xUnit 2.6.1 with .NET Test SDK 17.8.0

**Rationale:**
- **Modern Standard**: xUnit is the recommended testing framework for .NET Core/.NET 5+
- **Attribute-Based**: Clean `[Fact]` and `[Theory]` attributes for test methods
- **Data-Driven Testing**: `[InlineData]` support for parameterized tests
- **Parallel Execution**: Built-in test parallelization for better performance
- **Visual Studio Integration**: Excellent tooling support and test explorer integration

#### 4.3 Test Coverage Strategy
**Implemented Test Categories:**
- **Unit Tests**: 23 `[Fact]` tests for specific scenarios
- **Theory Tests**: 6 `[Theory]` tests with multiple `[InlineData]` parameters
- **Exception Tests**: `Assert.Throws<T>()` for error validation
- **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary values and special inputs

**Coverage Goals Achieved:**
- **100% Method Coverage**: All public methods in `NumberToWordsService` tested
- **Path Coverage**: All major code paths through conversion logic tested
- **Error Coverage**: All exception scenarios validated
- **Business Logic Coverage**: All number conversion patterns verified


## Number to Words Algorithm Design

### Core Algorithm Structure
The conversion algorithm follows a hierarchical breakdown approach:
1. **Input Validation**: Ensures valid decimal format using `decimal.TryParse()`
2. **Separation**: Splits whole and fractional parts at decimal point
3. **Decimal Processing**: Truncates fractional part to 2 digits (currency precision)
4. **Chunking**: Processes numbers in groups of three digits
5. **Scale Application**: Applies appropriate scale words (thousand, million, etc.)
6. **Currency Formatting**: Adds "DOLLARS" and "CENTS" with proper pluralization

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Decimal Truncation Strategy
```csharp
var centsPart = parts[1].PadRight(2, '0').Substring(0, 2);
fractionalPart = Convert.ToInt32(centsPart);
```

**Rationale:**
- **Currency Precision**: Standard currency has exactly 2 decimal places (cents)
- **Truncation vs Rounding**: Truncation chosen for predictable behavior
- **Zero Padding**: Ensures consistent processing for inputs like "1.1" → "1.10"
- **Substring Safety**: `Substring(0, 2)` ensures only first 2 digits are processed

**Behavior Examples:**
- `1.999` → processes as `1.99` (truncated, not rounded to `2.00`)
- `1.1` → processes as `1.10` (zero-padded)
- `1.001` → processes as `1.00` (effectively no cents)

#### 2. Chunk-based Processing
```csharp
while (number > 0)
{
    var chunk = number % 1000;
    // Process chunk...
    number /= 1000;
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Scalability**: Handles large numbers efficiently
- **Pattern Recognition**: Numbers follow predictable three-digit patterns
- **Memory Efficiency**: Processes numbers iteratively rather than recursively

#### 3. Lookup Arrays vs. Switch Statements
```csharp
private readonly string[] ones = {"", "ONE", "TWO", ...};
private readonly string[] tens = {"", "", "TWENTY", "THIRTY", ...};
```

**Rationale:**
- **Performance**: Array lookups are O(1) operations
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify number words without code changes
- **Readability**: Clear mapping between numbers and words

#### 4. Hyphenation for Compound Numbers
```csharp
result += tens[tensDigit];
if (onesDigit > 0)
    result += "-" + ones[onesDigit];
```

**Rationale:**
- **Standard Convention**: "TWENTY-ONE" follows English language conventions
- **Readability**: Improves clarity of compound numbers
- **Consistency**: Uniform formatting across all compound numbers

#### 5. Special Handling for Teens (11-19)
```csharp
private readonly string[] ones = {
    "", "ONE", "TWO", ..., "TEN", "ELEVEN", "TWELVE", "THIRTEEN", ...
};
```

**Rationale:**
- **Language Rules**: Eleven through nineteen don't follow standard patterns
- **Accuracy**: Ensures correct English representation
- **Simplicity**: Avoids complex conditional logic

## Error Handling Strategy

### Input Validation
- **Null/Empty Checks**: Prevents null reference exceptions
- **Format Validation**: Uses `decimal.TryParse()` for robust parsing
- **Range Validation**: Ensures numbers are within supported range
- **Negative Number Rejection**: Currency amounts should be positive

### Structured Error Responses
```csharp
public class ConversionResponse
{
    public string Words { get; set; }
    public bool Success { get; set; }
    public string? ErrorMessage { get; set; }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Client Guidance**: Clear error messages help users correct input
- **API Consistency**: Uniform response structure for all cases
- **Debugging Support**: Detailed error information for troubleshooting

## Currency Format Decision

### Singular vs. Plural Forms
- "ONE DOLLAR" vs. "TWO DOLLARS"
- "ONE CENT" vs. "NINETY-NINE CENTS"

**Rationale:**
- **English Grammar**: Follows standard pluralization rules
- **Professional Appearance**: Matches expectations for financial applications
- **User Experience**: Sounds natural when read aloud

### "AND" Conjunction Usage
- Between hundreds and tens: "ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-THREE"
- Between dollars and cents: "TWENTY DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS"

**Rationale:**
- **Common Usage**: Matches how people naturally speak numbers
- **Clarity**: Improves readability and comprehension
- **Requirement Compliance**: Matches the example format provided

## Performance Considerations

### Algorithm Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) where n is the input number
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) using iterative processing

### Memory Efficiency
- **Immutable Lookup Arrays**: Shared across all instances
- **StringBuilder Alternative**: String concatenation is acceptable for expected input sizes
- **No Recursion**: Avoids stack overflow for large numbers


## Alternatives Considered and Rejected

### 1. Recursive Algorithm
**Rejected because:**
- Stack overflow risk for large numbers
- Higher memory usage
- More complex error handling

### 2. External Libraries (Humanizer, etc.)
**Rejected because:**
- Exercise specifically requested original implementation
- Reduces learning and skill demonstration
- External dependencies add complexity

### 3. Database Storage for Number Words
**Rejected because:**
- Unnecessary complexity for static data
- Performance overhead
- No persistence requirements

### 4. Microservices Architecture
**Rejected because:**
- Over-engineering for simple requirement
- Adds deployment complexity
- Single-responsibility service is sufficient

## Deployment Strategy - 

### Docker Containerization
**Status**: **COMPLETE** - Production-ready containerization implemented

#### Multi-Stage Docker Build
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
# Build stage - compiles and publishes application

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS runtime  
# Runtime stage - minimal production image
```

**Rationale:**
- **Image Optimization**: Multi-stage build reduces final image size by excluding SDK
- **Security**: Runtime image contains only necessary components
- **Build Efficiency**: Leverages Docker layer caching for faster builds

#### Security Considerations
```dockerfile
# Non-root user execution
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 appgroup && \
    adduser --system --uid 1001 --gid 1001 --no-create-home appuser
USER appuser
```

**Benefits:**
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Application runs as non-root user (UID 1001)
- **Attack Surface Reduction**: Limited system access reduces security risks
- **Container Security Best Practices**: Follows OWASP container security guidelines

#### Production Features
- **Health Checks**: Built-in HTTP health monitoring endpoint
- **Environment Configuration**: Production-ready environment variables
- **Port Management**: Configurable port binding (default 5000)
- **Resource Optimization**: .dockerignore excludes unnecessary files

#### Container Orchestration Support
**Docker Compose**: Included `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployment
```yaml
services:
  numbertowords:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:5000/"]
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Deployment Options:**
- **Local Development**: `docker run` for quick testing
- **Production**: `docker-compose` for orchestrated deployment
- **Cloud Ready**: Compatible with Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances
- **CI/CD Integration**: Standard Dockerfile works with GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps

#### Performance Characteristics
